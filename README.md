## 🧠 Model
- Typical pipeline: preprocessing → feature engineering → **Random Forest Regressor** (or similar)
- Metrics: R² / MAE / RMSE (add yours here)

## ⚙️ Setup

1) **Clone** this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
```

2) **Create venv** (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3) **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Streamlit App (optional)
If you have the Streamlit app in `car_price_app` or `app.py`:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
# or
streamlit run car_price_app/app.py
```

---

## 📓 Run the Notebooks
Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and run cells in order.  
Make sure the `data/` paths inside notebooks point to the correct location.

---

## 📚 Dataset
- Describe your data source here (e.g., Kaggle link or local CSV)
- If you cannot share the dataset, provide a link or a small sample

---

## 🖼️ Screenshots (optional)
Add one or two images of your EDA plots or app UI here.
